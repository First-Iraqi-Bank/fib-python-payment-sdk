## Installation

Install the SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install fib-python-payment-sdk
```

### Alternative Installation (Without pip)

You can clone the repository and manually include the SDK in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/First-Iraqi-Bank/fib-python-payment-sdk.git
```

Ensure to include the SDK directory in your Python path.

---

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables to configure the SDK:

- `FIB_API_KEY`: Your FIB payment API key.
- `FIB_API_SECRET`: Your FIB payment API secret.
- `FIB_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the FIB payment API.
- `FIB_GRANT_TYPE`: Authentication grant type (default: client_credentials).
- `FIB_REFUNDABLE_FOR`: Transaction refund period (default: P7D).
- `FIB_CURRENCY`: Transaction currency (default: IQD).
- `FIB_CALLBACK_URL`: Callback URL for handling payment notifications.

Got it! You want to include the functionality as part of the SDK usage examples in the documentation, without referencing an actual file. Hereâ€™s how you can structure that:

### Usage of the SDK

Below is a basic example of how to use the SDK to handle payment operations directly within your application.

#### Payment Operations Example

This example demonstrates how to perform common payment operations, including creating a payment, checking its status, issuing a refund, and canceling a payment.

1. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   Ensure you have loaded the necessary environment variables for the SDK.

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   # Load environment variables from the .env file
   load_dotenv()
   ```

2. **Initialize Services**:
   Create instances of the authentication and payment integration services.

   ```python
   from fib_python_payment_sdk.services.fib_auth_integration_service import FIBAuthIntegrationService
   from fib_python_payment_sdk.services.fib_payment_integration_service import FIBPaymentIntegrationService

   # Initialize the authentication service
   auth_service = FIBAuthIntegrationService()

   # Initialize the payment integration service
   payment_service = FIBPaymentIntegrationService(auth_service)
   ```

3. **Create a Payment**:

   To create a payment, use the following function:

   ```python
   def create_payment(amount, callback_url, description):
       try:
           payment_response = payment_service.create_payment(amount, callback_url, description)
           payment_details = {
               'fib_payment_id': payment_response['paymentId'],
               'readable_code': payment_response['readableCode'],
               'personal_app_link': payment_response['personalAppLink'],
               'valid_until': payment_response['validUntil'],
           }
           return payment_details
       except Exception as e:
           print("Error during payment creation:", str(e))
           return None
   ```

   Example usage:

   ```python
   payment_details = create_payment(1000, 'http://localhost/callback', 'Test payment description')
   print("Payment Details:", payment_details)
   ```

4. **Check Payment Status**:

   To check the status of a payment:

   ```python
   def check_payment_status(payment_id):
       try:
           status = payment_service.check_payment_status(payment_id)
           return status
       except Exception as e:
           print("Error during payment status check:", str(e))
           return None
   ```

   Example usage:

   ```python
   if payment_details:
       payment_id = payment_details['fib_payment_id']
       status = check_payment_status(payment_id)
       print("Payment Status:", status)
   ```

5. **Refund a Payment**:

   To refund a payment:

   ```python
   def refund_payment(payment_id):
       try:
           refund_response = payment_service.refund(payment_id)
           return refund_response.status_code
       except Exception as e:
           print("Error during refund:", str(e))
           return None
   ```

   Example usage:

   ```python
   if payment_details:
       payment_id = payment_details['fib_payment_id']
       refund_status_code = refund_payment(payment_id)
       print("Refund Status Code:", refund_status_code)
   ```

6. **Cancel a Payment**:

   To cancel a payment:

   ```python
   def cancel_payment(payment_id):
       try:
           cancel_response = payment_service.cancel(payment_id)
           return cancel_response.status_code
       except Exception as e:
           print("Error during cancellation:", str(e))
           return None
   ```

   Example usage:

   ```python
   if payment_details:
       payment_id = payment_details['fib_payment_id']
       cancel_status_code = cancel_payment(payment_id)
       print("Cancel Status Code:", cancel_status_code)
   ```

This structure provides clear examples of how to use the SDK for payment operations, focusing on practical usage rather than code organization in a specific file.
